# **Steam-Achievement-Master**

## **Tool Description**
This is a lightweight achievement unlocking tool designed for Steam players. We understand that unlocking certain in-game achievements can be time-consuming or sometimes impossible due to technical issues. This tool provides a simple, safe, and efficient solution, allowing you to easily unlock all achievements for your favorite games and complete your gaming record.
Developed using the Steamworks API, this tool accurately targets and unlocks achievements using just a game's App ID. The process requires no installation or complex setup, providing a smooth user experience.

## **Before You Begin**
This tool only works if you have the Steam client open and running.
For the tool to function correctly, please ensure the steam_appid.txt file is in the same folder as your executable (.exe).

## **Instructions**
### 1. Preparation
Please ensure the Steam client is open and you are logged into your account.
Go to https://steamdb.info/ and use the search bar to find the unique App ID for the game you want to unlock achievements for.

### 2. Set the App ID
Navigate to your tool's folder and open the steam_appid.txt file with any text editor (like Notepad).
Enter the App ID you just found into this file, then save and close it.

### 3. Run the Tool
Double-click to run the main.exe file.

The tool will automatically communicate with the Steam server and begin unlocking all achievements for that game.
Once the process is complete, you will see a success message in the console window. You have now successfully unlocked all of the game's achievements.
